## Workflows
### 1.Choosing Server and Setting up Wordpress
For we can update the site online, we have to publish the website on the server. I chose the server called Linode and 
located the server in Singapore. I also bought a specific domain name for our website which is assignment.best on the 
Namesilo. If we want to build a domain name in China local servers, we have to put it on records under the laws, which 
will be more complex.  
After publishing the site on the server, I connected the Wordpress site to the link I had created before. I created 5 
more administrator accounts in Wordpressfor as well, so the rest of our team members can edit the site online at the 
same time.
### 2.Starting Edit our Theme for the Site
We downloaded a plugin called Nicepage which is a site editor that can let us designed the site more convenient, but later 
there were some problems when displaying the pages after clicking the navigation buttons. We figured out that there might 
be some problems between the adaptation of Nicepage and Wordpress, so we changed to another site editor which called Elementor
which is a popular editor among the users of Wordpress, and we successfully solved the problems when building the theme 
of our site. You can see more details in theme.md.
### 3.Editing Other Pages for the Site
We had six members in our group so each of us had to edit one page. We edited the pages by our own and at the final group 
meeting we unified the styles to beautify the site. You can see more details in site.md.
### 4.Updating Work Progress on Github
We did some conclusion of our works and meetings we had before, and we also collected all the tools and plugins we used 
for developing the Baizonn Learning Center. Then updated them to the Github so others can see what we exactly did for 
our site development. For our meeting records you can check with the meeting-records.md.
### 5.Record the Video for our Presentation
We decided to make each person to show part of our work flows and the testing of our final project. We chose to use zoom 
recording instead of recording the video separately then combine them together, which will be more like to a live presentation.
### 6.Writing Individual Reflections
For each of us, we have to write a LinkedIn report about what we had learned during the process of developing the Baizonn 
Learning Center by using Wordpress, and about our group communications as well. we also have to record a video about the 
experiences we gained from this assignment.
