## Progress of Development
Before we started our word, we had a discussion with all group members. Everyone contributed personal opinions about our 
theme of the Baizonn Learning Center after refering various of companies' websites, especially those companies which engage 
in education. Then, we decided some basic elements of the theme, and most of them had achieved in the presented works, but 
the process of making this page was not a smooth going. We used a plugin called Nicepage to edit the theme at first, but 
then we found out that it cannot suit the Wordpress properly, so there are some problems on displaying those pages after 
clicking the buttons. So we turned into another site editor plugin called Elementor which is more popular among the users of
Wordpress, but we had to start over again, and all of our initial works were just in vain. One reason that we didn't choose 
Wordpress default editor is that it has many limitations which hindered us to achieve the same outlook and function like 
previous work does,such as the slider. So we chosed to use Elementor at last and made our site successfully and smoothly.
